    <h1>About This Tool</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Password Leak Checker! This tool was built to help you quickly check if your passwords
      have appeared in known data breaches. It is <strong>privacy-first</strong> and safe to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      All checks are done securely in your browser using the Have I Been Pwned API, which allows you to
      check passwords without ever sending the full password online.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is also a learning project in cybersecurity and web development, aiming to help people
      improve their online security.
